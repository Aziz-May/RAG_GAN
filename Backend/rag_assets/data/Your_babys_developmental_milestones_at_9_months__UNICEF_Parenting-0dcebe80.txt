By 9 months, your baby is much more mobile and likes to explore. Babies at this age are crawling and can raise themselves to stand, so safety in the home becomes an important issue as your baby's curiosity (and mobility) grows. Your baby now responds to their name, loves to cuddle with family members and may show shyness or fear of strangers. Games like peek-a-boo and pat-a-cake are sure to be a big hit with your 9-month-old.

Test your knowledge

True or false? "Baby talk" is a silly way to talk to your baby.

False! Babies love baby talk. Babies can't understand language yet, but they do hear the exaggerated tones that adults use when they speak to them in baby talk.

Social and emotional milestones at 9 months

Some of the ways you’ll see your little one learning to connect with the people around them at 9 months:

Starting to cling onto adults they're familiar with

Might be afraid of strangers

Has favourite toys that they reach for often

Tips for parents

Follow your baby’s signals by letting them take the lead during playtime.

Language and communication milestones at 9 months

How your baby is expressing their needs:

Pointing at things with their fingers

Understands the word "no" and makes lots of different sounds

Starts to copy movements they see and sounds they hear

Tips for parents

Because your baby loves to point, read some board books with pictures. They’ll be able to show you what they're interested in.

Cut out pictures from magazines and create your own story about the objects or people in the picture.

Identify the objects your baby notices in their everyday environment or in the house and name them. This will help with their linguistic and communication development.

Brain development milestones at 9 months

Likes to play peek-a-boo and look for things you hide

Tips for parents

Support and encourage your baby during playtime.

Help them develop their fine-motor skills by giving them small objects to pick up while under your supervision.
