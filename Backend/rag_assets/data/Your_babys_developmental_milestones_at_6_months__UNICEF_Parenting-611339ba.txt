At 6 months, your baby will start using sounds to express emotion. They may mimic sounds they hear, like "ma,” “da,” “ah,” “oh" and even "no!" Your little one will begin to recognize familiar faces, reach and grasp for toys and will soon be crawling — start preparing your home (and yourself) for a mobile child!

Get ready by removing any sharp, breakable or electric objects from your child’s reach, locking closets with dangerous liquids or supplies (or putting them in a safe place) and closing windows to ensure your child’s safety.

Test your knowledge
