Social and emotional milestones at 2 months

Some of the ways you’ll see your little one learning to connect with the people around them at 2 months:

Can self-soothe by sucking on their hand

Starting to smile at others

Attempting to look at their parents

Tips for parents

Engage in skin-to-skin contact. Your warmth will help soothe them.

Hold your baby close to your face and make eye contact. This will help your little one learn your features.

Language and communication milestones at 2 months

How your baby is engaging and expressing their needs:

Alerted by sounds and turns toward them

Making cooing noises

Tips for parents

Have “conversations” with your baby when they make cooing noises by speaking back to them in a baby talk voice. This back and forth is important for helping them to develop language and communication skills.

Movement and physical development milestones at 2 months

How they’ll move through their environment:

Arm and leg motions will be smoother

Can push up while on their belly and hold their head up

Tips for parents

Participate in tummy-time with your little one by facing your baby and speaking with them while they are placed on their stomach in front of you.

Encourage them to move their head, arms and legs by moving safe toys around them.

Food and nutrition milestones at 2 months

What mealtimes look like at 2 months:

All of the nutrition your baby needs can be found in breastmilk.

They’ll easily suck and swallow during feeding.

Their tongue will move back and forward to suck.

They'll latch onto their mother’s nipple or a bottle.

Tips for parents

You should see signs of hunger about 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. Newborn babies need to eat a lot because they’re growing rapidly. They double their birth weight in the first six months of life, or before.

Things to look out for

While all babies develop differently, you should speak to your paediatrician if your 2-month-old:

Can’t latch while nursing or bottle feeding.

Loses a lot of breastmilk or formula out of the side of their mouth while feeding.

Won’t smile at people.

Doesn’t bring their hands to their mouth.

Has no response to loud noises.

Doesn’t track people and objects as they move.

Is unable to hold their head up while on their tummy.
